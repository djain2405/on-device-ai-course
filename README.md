📘 **On-Device AI Course**

_The Open Guide to Building Intelligent Mobile Apps (iOS + Android)_
By Divya Jain

Welcome to the On-Device AI Course - a modular, hands-on curriculum designed to help mobile developers build fast, private, intelligent apps that run entirely on the device.

AI is no longer confined to the cloud.
Your iPhone and Android devices now have Neural Engines, NNAPI, GPU delegates, and optimized ML runtimes capable of running powerful models offline.

This course shows you how to use them - clearly, practically, and without overwhelm.
